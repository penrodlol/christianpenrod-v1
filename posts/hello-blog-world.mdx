To anyone who may be reading this, welcome to my adventure into the dev blog
world! Now where to start ...

<Spacer />

Over the past couple years, I&apos;ve been super intrigued and inspired by the
seemingly infinite amount of dev blogs across the web. Although reading
documentation directly from a technology&apos;s source is essential, nothing
quite beats a solid blog post that&apos;s directly from those within the
trenches solving <FancyText>real world</FancyText> problems and demonstrating
how to do so along the way. With all this in mind, I figured why not extend that
favor and give this blog stuff a shot.

<Spacer />

I believe it&apos;s essential to establish a high level understanding of what
technical field(s) will be covered across these blog posts. For the context of
mine, I will be focusing primarily on <FancyText>web development</FancyText>.
Although, I also believe it&apos;s valid to sprinkle in other useful areas of
technology every once and awhile. Like most blog posts I find value in, I will
add as many code snippets as possible to denote what I&apos;m trying to explain
if not clear just by reading. Having a visual example goes a long way.

<Spacer />

Taking all this into mind, I again welcome you to my journey within the dev blog
realm and hope anyone reading these will find <FancyText>real world</FancyText>
value in them.
